Abstract: The remaining useful life (RUL) can be predicted using the information related to the equipment health state, and
the decisions of maintenance and spare ordering are made to reduce the cost associated with maintenance and spare parts. A
joint  policy  of  maintenance  and  spare  ordering  for  single-component  systems  is  proposed  based  on  RUL,  in  which  the
control  limit  policy  is  used  to  maintenance  decision-making,  i.e.  judging  whether  a  preventive  replacement  or  a  failure
replacement  is  performed  depending  on  the  degradation  level.  Meanwhile,  the  RUL  at  each  monitoring  time  is  estimated
based on the historical degradation information, and the order threshold is introduced to decide whether an order is made or
not.  All  possible  renewal  scenarios  are  obtained  by  analyzing  the  spare  state  when  the  replacement  is  required,  and  the
corresponding  occurrence  probability  is  derived  to  calculate  the  expected  cost  and  length.  Then,  the  joint  policy  model  is
established to minimize the expected cost per unit time, and a discrete event simulation algorithm is designed to address the
proposed model. Finally, a case study is given to demonstrate the proposed model and algorithm, and the minimal expected
cost per unit time is 14.656 3 with regard to the optimal preventive replacement threshold 8 and the optimal spare ordering
threshold 1 000.
